<h2>FOP assignment</h2>

Work on the main function calls first. Ill see what we can do about UI later but should be pretty easy after implementing main functions

# Main functions
### -Search (s/null) JACK'S WORKING ON IT
> query(String[] <list of search parameters>) returns int[]<index of links satisfying condition>
  
> dispLink(int <index>) returns String<html formatted output/raw link>

### -Calculator (c) DONE
> calc(String <equation>) returns double <ans>
  
> *append $ to end of equation input string
  
### -Currency Exchange (x) DONE
> x <amount> <money1> to <money2>
  
> exchange(double <amount>, String <money1>, String <money2>) return double <answer>


# Minigames (g) 
<h2 color="blue">ZI JING & ZHI EN ARE WORKING ON IT</h2>
>g game name 
  
>game name valid? playgame:error msg; # basically make a checking function to make sure the game exists and if so call the games main function
  
### -Tic tac toe
> u know how to play tic tac toe right?

### -Die roll
>roll 2 50 # rolls random int from 2-50

>roll(int low_bound, int upp_bound) returns int <random int in range>
  
>animation while rolling?
 
 
# Additional Features
## SOH & STANLEY ARE WORKING ON IT
### -Binomial Expansion 
> do binomial expansion loo

### -Truth table and karnaugh map plotter
> receive equation and plot truth table and karnaugh map

> I reccomend splitting atleast 2 functions with one doing raw output in boolean[]/bitmasked-int[] and one to display

> Bitmask is a lightweight way to store bools that i find rlly cool but is obviously overkill for this task but u can try if u wanna show off


# Maybe?
### -Bridge?
### -Polynomial graph plotter?
### -Logic cicuit plotter?
### -Integrater differentiator with steps?
